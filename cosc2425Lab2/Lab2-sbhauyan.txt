public class Lab2Prt1 {

	public static void main(String[] args) {
		System.out.println("Howdy");
		
		// here the print statement should be after the class main, and there should be " " double quotation sign to print something 

	}

}

console1
Howdy




problem-2

// this is program which will only print a general statement for the program which will print the line "I like the program" 
// here we will only use the System.out.println statement to print that line, nothing else

package cosc2425Lab2asg2;

public class Lab2Prt2 {

	public static void main(String[] args) {
		// TODO Auto-generated method stub
		System.out.println("I like the program");  
		

	}

}

console-2
I like the program




problem-3

// here in this program the name of the class is Lab2Prt3, here we will use the build in String class to assign the names in first_name and last_name variable
// and will align then together by using (+)

package cosc2425Lab2asg2;

public class Lab2Prt3 {

	public static void main(String[] args) {
		// TODO Auto-generated method stub
		String first_name = "James";
		String last_name = "Gosling";
		System.out.println(last_name + "," + first_name);
		
	}

}


console-3
Gosling,James



problem-4

// in this program we are declaring a int variable. So at first we need to declare the variable name first by using the (int drivingAge;) method
// then in the next line we will assign 15 to the variable drivingAge
// in the next line we will print the given statement in the question along with the age by + sign 

package cosc2425Lab2asg2;

public class Lab2Prt4 {

	public static void main(String[] args) {
		// TODO Auto-generated method stub
		int drivingAge;
		drivingAge = 15;
		System.out.println("The driver's age provided is: "+ drivingAge );

	}

}



console-4
The driver's age provided is: 15




problem-5

// here since we have to print a string variable's value assigned to it in a sentence, we need to assign the the value within double quotation
// like this myName = "15", so in the print statement the valu will be printed but it will remain in the string form
package cosc2425Lab2asg2;

public class Lab2Prt5 {

	public static void main(String[] args) {
		// TODO Auto-generated method stub
		String myName;
		 myName = "15";
		 System.out.println("The name assigned to the variable myName is: " + myName);
	}

}


console5
The name assigned to the variable myName is: 15



problem-6

// here in this program we are declaring two variables one in an int variable and another is double variable 
// then we formatted the print statement with a comma between the two variables and assigned a newline character at the end in quotation
// this newline character will help to print the next line after a newline
package cosc2425Lab2asg2;

public class Lab2Prt6 {

	public static void main(String[] args) {
		// TODO Auto-generated method stub
		int num = 23;
		double cost = 57.65;
		System.out.println(num + "," + cost + "\n");
		System.out.println("Yes, I included the newline character");

	}

}


console-6
23,57.65

Yes, I included the newline character





problem-7

package cosc2425Lab2asg2;

public class Lab2Prt7 {

	public static void main(String[] args) {
		// TODO Auto-generated method stub
		boolean isACustomer = true; 
		
		// here the variable isCuatomer is a boolean value and it is assigned true
		
		boolean loyaltyProgram = false; 
		
		// here the variable loyaltyProgram is a boolean value and it is assigned false 
		System.out.println("Is the person a customer? :" + isACustomer); 
		System.out.println("Is the person in the Loyalty Program?: " + loyaltyProgram);

	}

}

console-7
Is the person a customer? :true
Is the person in the Loyalty Program?: false





problem-8

package cosc2425Lab2asg2;

public class Lab2Prt8 {

	public static void main(String[] args) {
		// TODO Auto-generated method stub
		int num = 23;
		double cost= 57.65;
		double unitPrice;
		unitPrice = cost/num;
		
		// here we are dividing the total cost by the total number of items in order to get the unit cost of that item
		// here we also assigned the unitPrice variable as double since a division of double number by int number will generate another double
		
		System.out.println("Given the number of units: " + num);
		System.out.println("value of cost: " + cost);
		System.out.println("value of unit price: " + unitPrice); 
		
	}

}

console-8
Given the number of units: 23
value of cost: 57.65
value of unit price: 2.506521739130435




problem-9
package cosc2425Lab2asg2;

public class Lab2Prt9 {

	public static void main(String[] args) {
		// TODO Auto-generated method stub
		double width1 = 12.43;
		double width2 = 30.62;
		double length1 = 7.99;
		double length2 = 41.51;
		double area1 = width1*length1;
		double area2 = width2*length2;
		
		// here I calculated the areas of two rectangles by declaring a double variable for each of the area since
		// the width and length of each of the rectangle was in double
		
		System.out.println("Given the width and length of room1 as: " + width1 + ", " + length1);
		System.out.println("Given the width and length of room2 as: " + width2 + ", " + length2);
		System.out.println( "the total floor-space area calculates to: " + (area1 + area2));
		
		// here in this print statement we just used the (+) operator to add the two areas which we found earlier because (+) operator 
		// adds any two or more  numeric variable as int, double, float etc


	}

}


console-9
Given the width and length of room1 as: 12.43, 7.99
Given the width and length of room2 as: 30.62, 41.51
the total floor-space area calculates to: 1370.3519000000001
